=============

A basic CRUD inventory management app for an imaginary store.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://odin-node-inventory-app.adaptable.app/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) curriculum. It is the third project required for completion of the NodeJS Course [3/9].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Set up an Express project and a new PostgreSQL database.
- [x] Set up the routes and controllers you’re going to need.
- [x] Create all of the ‘READ’ views (i.e. view category, and view item).
- [x] Create all the forms and build out the controllers you need for the create and update actions.
- [x] Implement a delete functionality.
- [x] Deploy the app and the database on any PaaS of your choice.
- [x] EXTRA CREDIT
  - [x] Figure out how to protect destructive actions (like deleting and updating) by making users enter a secret admin password to confirm the action.    

What I Learned
-----

Well, there's a lot to unpack here. This is my first full-stack app, built with a relational database. 

I learned the basics of SQL, MVC, HTTP methods, working in a local/production environment, and setting up a PostgreSQL database.

I also learned the basics of deployment, relational databases, middleware functions (especially .env), and more.

It was fun to set up a project like this, and I can't wait to learn more advanced stuff.

Notes
-----

This app was built using NodeJS, Express, EJS, PostgreSQL, and pure HTML/CSS/Javascript.

The database and the app are hosted at https://adaptable.io/ (big shoutout to the folks behind Adaptable for making such an awesome free plan).

It is NOT mobile-friendly, as I only tend to focus on time-consuming details (like responsive design) when a project demands it.

P.S. — You need a password to perform most actions. This way, tricksters won't be able to add "funny names" to the database. However, if you want to test the CRUD methods, contact me and I'll give you a temporary password.
